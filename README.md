# Electronics Department - Equipment Management System
University Institute of Computing, Chandigarh University

ESP8266 + MFRC522 + OLED reader -> FastAPI server (MySQL) -> React web app, now **live on the internet**,
with **student self-registration by QR code** and **several laboratories in one system**.

```
firmware/lab_rfid_node/   Arduino sketch for the NodeMCU reader (hardware is unchanged)
backend/                  FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + MySQL
frontend/                 React web app (frontend/dist is the ready-built website)
render.yaml               one-click setup for the free Render host
```

## What is new in this version
| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| Live website | One free Render service serves the website and the API. Database on TiDB Cloud (free). |
| QR registration | Each lab has a QR code. The student opens a form on his phone, submits, and the request appears on the teacher's **Registrations** page. The teacher taps the student's ID card on the reader and approves. |
| Stock by every staff role | Administrator, teacher and lab assistant can all add and edit stock. **Change history** records who changed what, the old and new numbers and the reason. |
| Several labs | Every item, loan, reader and QR code belongs to a lab. Staff see only the labs assigned to them; the administrator sees all and switches lab in the sidebar. Students register once and can borrow in any lab (they must tap their card at **that** lab's reader). |
| Reader security | Every reader has its own ID and key, tied to one lab. Keys are stored only as hashes and can be renewed. |
| E-mail | Sent through the Gmail API over HTTPS (free cloud hosts block normal SMTP). Switching to the teacher's Gmail needs only new environment variables. |

## 1. Upgrading the system you already have (no data loss)
1. Stop the backend. Extract this zip over your project folder (your `venv`, `node_modules` and `.env` are not in the zip).
2. `cd backend`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then start as before (`uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).
3. On the first start the system upgrades the database by itself: it creates the first laboratory, moves **all existing stock, loans and scans into it**, assigns your existing teachers and assistants to it, and keeps your reader working (the old `DEVICE_KEY` becomes the key of reader `LAB-RFID-01`). Nothing is deleted.
4. Rebuild the website only if you change the code (`cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`).
5. The reader sketch needs re-uploading only when you move to the live server (see step 6).

## 2. Put the project on GitHub
Create a GitHub account and a **private** repository, then upload the whole project folder. Keep the folder `frontend/dist` (it is the built website, so Render does not need Node). Never upload `.env`.

## 3. Database: TiDB Cloud (free)
1. Sign up at tidbcloud.com and create a free **Starter** cluster (region nearest to you).
2. Open **Connect**, choose a general/"Python (PyMySQL)" connection, and note host, port (4000), user and password. Create a database called `lab_db` (or use the default one).
3. Your `DATABASE_URL` is: `mysql+pymysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:4000/lab_db`  (if the password has symbols such as `@` or `#`, write them URL-encoded, e.g. `@` = `%40`). Set `DB_SSL=true`.

## 4. Gmail sending (your Gmail now, the teacher's later)
Do this once. It gives the system permission to **send** mail from one Gmail account. It cannot read the mailbox.
1. Open console.cloud.google.com, create a project, then **APIs and Services > Library** and enable **Gmail API**.
2. **OAuth consent screen**: user type External, app name e.g. "Lab System", your e-mail as support and developer contact. Add the scope `.../auth/gmail.send`. Add the Gmail account that will send as a **test user**. Then press **Publish app** (status "In production"). Without this, Google expires the permission after 7 days. You may see an "unverified app" warning; for your own use this is fine.
3. **Credentials > Create credentials > OAuth client ID**, type **Desktop app**. Copy the client ID and secret.
4. On your PC, in the `backend` folder: `python tools/get_gmail_token.py CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET`. A browser opens: sign in with the Gmail account that should send, allow. The script prints `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` and `GMAIL_SENDER`.
5. **To switch to the teacher's Gmail later:** run step 4 again while signed in as the teacher (add the teacher as a test user first), then change only `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` and `GMAIL_SENDER` on the server and restart.

A normal Gmail account can send about 500 e-mails a day (check Google's current limit). Each issue sends two e-mails (code and receipt).

## 5. Render (free host)
1. Sign up at render.com with GitHub. **New > Blueprint**, pick your repository. Render reads `render.yaml`.
2. Fill the environment variables it asks for:
   - `DATABASE_URL` from step 3, `DB_SSL` is already true
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` your own first admin password (the server refuses to start with the example one)
   - `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `GMAIL_SENDER` from step 4
   - `PUBLIC_URL` the address Render gives you, e.g. `https://electronics-lab.onrender.com` (add it after the first deploy)
   - `SECRET_KEY`, `DEVICE_KEY`, `CRON_TOKEN` are generated for you (copy `CRON_TOKEN` for step 7)
3. Deploy. Open the address, sign in as `admin` with your `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and set a new password. Open **Settings > Send test email** to check the Gmail link.

## 6. Reader (hardware unchanged)
1. In the web app open **Labs and readers**. Your first reader `LAB-RFID-01` exists already; press **New key** to get a key you can copy (shown once).
2. In `lab_rfid_node.ino` set `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASS`, `SERVER_URL = "https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/api/rfid/scan"`, `DEVICE_ID` and `DEVICE_KEY` (the key you copied), then upload.
3. The reader must reach the internet. College Wi-Fi that asks for a login page will not work; use a hotspot or ask IT for a plain 2.4 GHz network.
4. Watch the Serial Monitor (115200) the first time: it prints the free memory at start. The HTTPS link encrypts the traffic but does not verify the server's certificate (`setInsecure()`); that is acceptable for a pilot, and pinning a certificate is a later improvement.

## 7. Reminders on a sleeping free server
Render's free service sleeps after about 15 minutes without visitors. The reader asks for screens every 3 seconds, so while it is powered the server stays awake. To make sure the daily reminders still go out, add a free job at cron-job.org that opens
`https://YOUR-APP.onrender.com/api/cron/reminders?token=YOUR_CRON_TOKEN` once a day.

## 8. QR registration
**Labs and readers > Registration QR** shows the QR code and link for a lab. Print it (Print button) and put it on the lab door or counter. A student scans it with the phone camera, fills the form and submits. Staff open **Registrations** (a red number in the menu shows how many are waiting), check the details, press **Start scan**, let the student tap the ID card, and press **Approve and register**. They can also send it back with a note or reject it; the student is told by e-mail each time.
Protection: no login is needed to submit, so the form allows only 5 attempts per address per 10 minutes, has a hidden trap field for bots, requires consent, and nothing becomes a student until staff approve.

## 9. Adding a second laboratory
1. **Labs and readers > Add laboratory** (name and short code).
2. Add its reader (**Add reader**, choose the lab), copy the key into that reader's sketch.
3. **Staff**: tick the labs each teacher or assistant may work in.
4. Add its stock inside that lab (switch lab in the sidebar). Print its own QR code.
A teacher of one lab cannot see or change another lab's stock, loans, scans or registrations.

## 10. What to expect on free plans (please check the providers' current terms)
- Render free: sleeps when idle; the first request after sleeping can take 30 to 60 seconds. Free services also cannot send SMTP e-mail, which is why Gmail API is used.
- TiDB Cloud Starter: free monthly allowance of storage and request units; the reader's 3-second polling is answered from memory most of the time to save it.
- This setup is fine for a demo and a small lab. For daily use by many students, a paid Render plan removes the sleeping.
- Only one server process is supported (the "waiting for card" state is kept in memory).

## Later changes (header, footer, QR on Students page, CSV import)
- **Heading and look:** the lab is shown as **UIC E2 - 212 Lab**, with a header bar (lab name, signed-in user with sign-out, Chandigarh University logo) and a footer with the contact details, in the style of the UIC Patent Portal pages. A "Need help?" card with the same contact is on the Dashboard.
- **Change the heading or the contact details:** edit `frontend/src/contact.js` (lab title, name, phone, e-mail, address), run `npm run build` in `frontend`, and upload the changed files **including `frontend/dist`** to GitHub. Render redeploys by itself. The header logo is `frontend/public/cu-logo.png`.
- **QR on the Students page:** **Registration QR** button, and a **Show QR code** option inside the Register student window. Open the site from its live address so the QR works on phones.
- **Inventory from a CSV file:** Inventory > **Import CSV**. Choose the file; the page checks every row and shows what will be added or updated. If any row has an error nothing is saved, and the rows with errors are listed. First row must be a header with `name` and `total`; optional columns `category, damaged, missing, maintenance, notes`. Names are matched without regard to capital letters, so a second import updates existing items. A choice lets you add new items only. Use **Download an example file** for the format. Everything imported is recorded in **Change history**.
- E-mails and the reader's OLED still say "Electronics Department"; they were not changed.

## Rules implemented (unchanged)
30-day loan, one 30-day renewal, fine per unit per day (all in Settings). Issue needs the student's own card scan on that lab's reader and one e-mailed code for the whole item list. OLED screens and receipt e-mails for every issue and return. Daily reminder e-mail listing all pending items.

## Tests that were run
Automated end-to-end tests (SQLite and MySQL/MariaDB): issue, return, fines, codes, receipts, reminders, labs, per-reader keys, QR registration with approval, rate limit, teacher stock edits and history, upgrade of an old database, production-safety checks, Gmail API request format (with a simulated Google). A real browser test covered the phone form, approval by card scan, labs, QR image, reader key and lab switcher. **Not tested here:** real Gmail delivery, TiDB Cloud itself, Render itself, and the new HTTPS firmware on the physical reader.
